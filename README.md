# Adaptive REsource-aware Split learning (ARES) for Internet of Things
### A scheme for efficient decentralised training in IoT systems. 
ARES accelerates local training in resource-constrained devices and minimizes the effect of stragglers on the training through device-targeted split points while accounting for time-varying network throughput and computing resources. ARES takes into account application constraints (energy sensitivity policy) to mitigate training optimization tradeoffs in terms of energy consumption and training time.
