# RES-Things
Adaptive  Resource-Aware  Split-Learning,  a  framework for efficient model  training in IoT systems. RES-Things accelerates local training in computationally constrained devicesand minimises stragglers in the training through device-targetedo ffloading  strategies  while  accounting  for  time-varying  network throughput  and  computing  resources.  Our  solution  takes  into account  application  constraints/objectives  to  mitigate  training optimisation tradeoffs  in  terms of  energy  consumption,  training  time  and  accuracy.
